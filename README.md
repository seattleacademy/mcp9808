# The Project
mcp9808 is a free-to-use library for controlling the mcp9808 temperature sensor from the raspberry pi. It includes support for all commands highlighted in the sensorâ€™s datasheet, and provides useful examples of how to use the library in the examples folder. The examples include tools from a basic command-line temperature reader to a complete web-based temperature controller. 
# Documentation

mcp9808 is available as an npm module. To download, simply run  sudo npm install mcp9808.
Then import and initialize the module in your Node.js program.

	var MCP9808 = new require('mcp9808');
	MCP9808.Initialize(function(){
		//your code here
	});

All commands in this library use callbacks. For example, if you want to get the temperature and tne log it to the screen, use this code.

	var MCP9808 = new require('mcp9808');
	MCP9808.Initialize(function(){
		MCP9808.AmbientTemperature(error, data)
		{
			console.log(data);
		});
	});
